# Fast Softmax on RV32IM Without FPU

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
> **Achieved up to 58% cycle reduction** for softmax execution on RV32IM platforms by replacing floating-point exponential with lightweight software approximations.  
> This project implements a fast, FPU-free softmax tailored for edge AI inference on integer-only RISC-V SoCs.

## Motivation

The softmax function is commonly used in classification tasks and transformer-based models such as MobileBERT.  
However, on RV32IM systems (no FPU), computing `exp(x)` is expensive in both latency and instruction count.

To address this, this project investigates and implements:
- Exponential approximations (e.g., polynomial/Hornerâ€™s method)
- Lookup table (LUT) based methods
- Accuracy vs. performance trade-offs

## Results

- Input: 512 random `float32` values in range `[0, 10)`
- Platform: RISC-V Spike + pk (RV32IMZf toolchain)
- Cycle count: ~**58% reduction** (vs glibc `expf`)
- Max absolute error: **0.0003**

### Performance Comparison
| Method                | Cycle Count | Time Reduction | Max Absolute Error |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | -----------------  |
| glibc expf (baseline) | 1,265,689   | 0%             | 0                  |
| Taylor3 (no LUT)      | 386,938     | 69.43%         | 0.0132             |
| Taylor3 + LUT         | 533,376     | 57.86%         | 0.0003             |

## System Overview

This project replaces the original softmax exponential with an efficient software approximation.
