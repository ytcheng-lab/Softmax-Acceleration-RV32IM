# Exponential Function Approximation for RV32IM Processors: Technical Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This document describes the software-level optimization of the exponential function for RISC-V RV32IM-class processors without hardware FPU support. The exponential function is a critical kernel in AI workloads such as softmax, sigmoid, and tanh. On minimal embedded cores lacking floating-point hardware, na√Øve implementations are prohibitively expensive. By analyzing standard library implementations and introducing approximation techniques such as Taylor series expansion, Horner's method, and lookup tables (LUT), this work demonstrates significant reductions in instruction-level cycle counts, making AI workloads more feasible on resource-constrained platforms.

## 2. Background and Motivation

### 2.1 Problem Context
- Many AI workloads require the exponential function, notably in softmax activation layers.
- RV32IM processors lack the F-extension (floating-point unit). All FP operations require software emulation.
- Exponential calculations are inherently nonlinear, demanding precision but consuming high cycle counts on such cores.

### 2.2 Motivation
- Optimize exponential computation at the software level.
- Make AI inference feasible on low-cost, low-power embedded systems.
- Provide insights for developers working on RISC-V-based AI inference.

## 3. Target Platform and Toolchain

- ISA: RISC-V RV32IM (no FPU)
- Toolchain: riscv-gnu-toolchain
- Simulator: Spike (for functional simulation)
- Cycle Measurement: Reading the mcycle CSR during execution to approximate dynamic cycle counts.

*Note:* Spike does not model microarchitectural stalls, caches, or pipelines. mcycle serves as a consistent proxy for dynamic instruction-level cost, enabling relative comparisons between optimization strategies.

## 4. Bottleneck Analysis of Existing Implementations

### 4.1 Study of GNU C Library (glibc) Implementation
- Uses range reduction via ln(2) scaling.
- Splits input into integer and fractional components.
- Integer component handled via bit-shifts and small LUT for precomputed powers of two.
- Fractional remainder approximated with low-degree Taylor expansion.
- Limitations on RV32IM:
  - Modular reductions and divisions are costly.
  - Type conversions between integer and floating-point are expensive.
  - LUT indexing incurs overhead.

### 4.2 Study of Cephes Implementation
- Uses Pade approximations for better precision.
- Performs range reduction similarly to glibc.
- Avoids LUTs in favor of more complex polynomial approximations.
- Limitations on RV32IM:
  - Division and floor operations required for range reduction.
  - Higher computational cost for polynomial evaluation.

## 5. Proposed Approximation Strategies

### 5.1 Taylor Series Approximation
- Approximates exp(x) over small intervals.
- Tunable degree allows trade-off between accuracy and cycle cost.
- Example used: (3rd-degree Taylor series approximation).
- On RV32IM, low-degree polynomials reduce multiplication count significantly.

### 5.2 Horner's Method
- Reduces polynomial evaluation complexity from quadratic to linear.
- Rewrites nested multiplications into a form with fewer operations.
- Improves performance on simple in-order pipelines.

---

### 5.3 Lookup Table (LUT)-Based Decomposition
- Decomposes x into integer and fractional parts (x = n + f).
- Uses LUT for precomputed exp(n) values.
- Evaluates exp(f) using low-degree Taylor approximation in the range [0, 1).
- Maintains precision while reducing dynamic range and computation cost.

  - LUT plus Taylor combination.
  - Same cycle measurement strategy.

## 8. Expected Results

| Method             | Expected Relative Cycle Count | Accuracy Trade-off       |
|---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| glibc expf          | 1x (baseline)                | Full library precision   |
| Taylor3 (Horner)    | ~0.3x baseline               | Slightly reduced         |
| LUT + Taylor3       | ~0.3x baseline               | Improved in target range |

- Absolute cycle counts will depend on input range and instruction mix.
- Exact measurements reported via mcycle in simulation.

## 9. Discussion

- Portability: Strategies work on any RV32IM-class core without FPU.
- Reproducibility: Fixed dataset ensures fair comparison.
- Spike Limitations: mcycle is an instruction-level proxy; does not capture cache, branch prediction, or pipeline stalls.
- Future Work:
  - Testing on real silicon with F-extension.
  - Extending range reduction schemes.
  - Evaluating higher-degree approximations.

## 10. Conclusion

By analyzing standard exponential implementations and proposing approximation strategies tailored for RV32IM-class processors, we demonstrate that significant cycle-count reductions are achievable purely in software. Taylor series approximation with Horner's method and LUT decomposition enable practical AI workloads on minimal embedded cores without FPU, making softmax and similar operations viable even in constrained environments.
